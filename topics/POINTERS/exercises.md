Exercise 1: Pointer Basics
Create a program that demonstrates basic pointer usage by declaring a pointer, assigning it the address of a variable, and using it to access the variable's value.

Expected Output:

```c
Value of num: 42
Value of num using pointer: 42
```

Exercise 2: Pointer Arithmetic
Create a program that demonstrates pointer arithmetic by iterating through an array using pointers.

Expected Output:

```c
Array elements using pointer arithmetic: 1 2 3 4 5
```

Exercise 3: Swapping Two Numbers Using Pointers
Create a program that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

Expected Output:

```c
Before swapping: num1 = 10, num2 = 20
After swapping: num1 = 20, num2 = 10
```

Exercise 4: Dynamic Array Using malloc and free
In C, you can use malloc to allocate memory dynamically and free to release that memory when it's no longer needed. Your task is to create a program that dynamically allocates an integer array, initializes it, and then frees the memory when done.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter the size of the array: 5
Array elements: 0 2 4 6 8
```
