Exercise 1: Basic FunctionC
Create a program that defines a simple function to calculate the square of a number and demonstrates how to use it.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter an integer: 5
Square of 5 is 25
```

Exercise 2: Function with Parameters and Return Value
Functions can take parameters and return values. Create a program that defines a function to find the maximum of two numbers and demonstrates its use.

Expected Output:

```
Enter two integers separated by a space: 8 12
Maximum: 12
```


Exercise: Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Create a program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive function.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter a positive integer n: 6
Fibonacci(6) = 8
```
