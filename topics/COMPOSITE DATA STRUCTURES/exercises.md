Exercise 1: Creating and Using Structs
Introduction: A struct in C allows you to create a composite data type that can hold multiple variables of different data types. Your task is to create a program that defines a struct representing a Student with name and age fields and demonstrates how to use it.

Expected Output:

```c
Student Name: Alice
Student Age: 20
```

Exercise 2: Typedef for Struct
Create a program that uses typedef to define a new type Student for the struct defined earlier and demonstrates how to use it.


Expected Output:

```c
Student Name: Alice
Student Age: 20
```
