Exercise 1: If-Else Statement
Create a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using an if-else statement.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter an integer: 5
The number is positive.

Enter an integer: -3
The number is negative.

Enter an integer: 0
The number is zero.
```

Exercise 2: Switch Statement
The switch statement in C is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed. Create a program that takes a number representing a day of the week (1-7) and displays the corresponding day name.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter a number (1-7) representing a day of the week: 3
Tuesday

Enter a number (1-7) representing a day of the week: 8
Invalid input
```

Exercise 3: Nested If-Else Statements
Create a program that determines if a given year is a leap year or not. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter a year: 2020
2020 is a leap year.

Enter a year: 1900
1900 is not a leap year.
