Exercise 1: Using #define for Constants

In C, you can define constants using the #define preprocessor directive. These constants are replaced with their values during preprocessing. Create a program that calculates the area of a circle using a #define constant for π (pi).

Expected Output:

```c
// Use radius = 5.0
Area of the circle: 78.539816
```

Exercise 2: Using const for Constants

In C, you can declare constants using the const keyword. Unlike #define, const variables are stored in memory, and their values cannot be changed. Write a program that calculates the area of a circle using a const variable for π (pi).

Expected Output:

```c
// Use radius = 5.0
Area of the circle: 78.539816
```

Exercise 3: Using #define for Macros

#define can be used to create macros in C, which are code substitutions. Macros are processed during preprocessing and can take arguments. Create a program that defines and uses a macro to calculate the square of a number.

Expected Output:

```c
Square of 5: 25
```
