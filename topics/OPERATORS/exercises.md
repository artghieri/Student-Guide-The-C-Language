Exercise 1: Arithmetic Operators
Create a program that demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) with two integer operands.

Expected Output:

```c
a + b = 13
a - b = 7
a * b = 30
a / b = 3
a % b = 1
```

Exercise 2: Assignment Operators
Create a program that demonstrates the use of various assignment operators (=, +=, -=) to modify variable values.

Expected Output:

```c
a = 13
b = 3
```


Exercise 3: Increment and Decrement Operators
Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. Create a program that demonstrates the use of both pre-increment and post-increment operators.

Expected Output:

```c
x = 6, y = 6
x = 6, y = 5
```

Exercise 4: Ternary Operator
The ternary operator (condition ? expr1 : expr2) allows you to conditionally choose between two expressions. Create a program that uses the ternary operator to determine whether a number is even or odd.

Expected Output:

```c
The number 7 is odd.
```

Exercise 5: Casting
Casting allows you to convert one data type to another explicitly. Create a program that demonstrates the use of casting to convert a floating-point number to an integer.

Expected Output:

```c
pi as double: 3.141593
pi as int (after casting): 3
```
