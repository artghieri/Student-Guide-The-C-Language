Exercise 1: While Loop
Create a program that uses a while loop to count from 1 to 5 and display the numbers.

Expected Output:

```c
Counting from 1 to 5 using a while loop:
1 2 3 4 5
```

Exercise 2: For Loop
Create a program that uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter a positive integer: 5
Factorial of 5 = 120
```

Exercise 3: Do-While Loop
Create a program that uses a do-while loop to find the sum of positive numbers entered by the user until a negative number is encountered.

Expected Output:

```c
Enter a positive number (or a negative number to exit): 5
Enter a positive number (or a negative number to exit): 7
Enter a positive number (or a negative number to exit): 3
Enter a positive number (or a negative number to exit): -1
Sum of positive numbers = 15
```
