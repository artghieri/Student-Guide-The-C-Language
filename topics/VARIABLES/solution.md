Exercise 1: Swap Two Variables
Write a program that swaps the values of two variables.

```c
# Introduction: This program swaps the values of two variables.
x = 5
y = 10

# Swapping using a temporary variable
temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}")
```

Exercise 2: Calculate Area of a Rectangle
Create a program that calculates and prints the area of a rectangle using length and width as variables.

> **TIP: Use * to multiplication operations**

```c
# Introduction: This program calculates the area of a rectangle.
length = 6
width = 4
area = length * width

print(f"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.")
```

Exercise 3: Variable Reassignment
Write a program that assigns a value to a variable, reassigns it, and then prints the updated value.

```c
# Introduction: This program demonstrates variable reassignment.
my_variable = 7
print("Initial value:", my_variable)

my_variable = 10
print("Updated value:", my_variable)
```
